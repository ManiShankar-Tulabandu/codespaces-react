        <h3>Storage and Transportation</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Hydrogen, being the lightest element, presents significant challenges in storage and transportation. It requires high-pressure tanks, cryogenic temperatures, or chemical carriers to be stored efficiently. These methods are energy-intensive and costly, posing a barrier to widespread adoption. Additionally, the infrastructure for hydrogen transportation is underdeveloped compared to conventional fuels, requiring substantial investment to establish pipelines and refueling stations.

        <h3>Infrastructure Development</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Developing a robust hydrogen infrastructure involves significant capital investment. This includes production facilities, storage systems, pipelines, and refueling stations. The current infrastructure is not equipped to handle hydrogen at the scale required for it to become a mainstream energy source. Coordinated efforts and substantial financial commitment from both public and private sectors are essential to build the necessary infrastructure.

        <h3>Regulations and Safety Concerns</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Hydrogen is highly flammable, and its safe handling requires stringent safety measures. Existing regulations need to be updated to address the specific hazards associated with hydrogen. This includes developing new standards for storage, transportation, and usage. Public perception of hydrogen safety is also a concern, necessitating education and transparent communication about the measures in place to mitigate risks.

        <h3>Production Costs</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The cost of producing hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen (produced using renewable energy), is currently higher than that of traditional fossil fuels. Electrolysis, one of the cleanest methods of hydrogen production, is energy-intensive and expensive. Reducing production costs through technological advancements and economies of scale is crucial for hydrogen to become a competitive alternative.

        <h3>Market Adoption</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Market adoption of hydrogen technologies faces several hurdles, including competition from established energy sources and the need for substantial investment in new infrastructure. Additionally, the current market demand for hydrogen is limited, requiring coordinated policies and incentives to stimulate growth. Overcoming these barriers involves government support, industry collaboration, and public acceptance.
