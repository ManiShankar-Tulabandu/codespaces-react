        <h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Hydrogen is a clean energy source that, when used in fuel cells or combusted, produces only water vapor and heat. This eliminates harmful emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates, significantly reducing the greenhouse gas effect and air pollution. Utilizing hydrogen can help countries meet their climate goals and reduce the impacts of global warming.

        <h3>High Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Hydrogen fuel cells are highly efficient compared to traditional combustion engines. They convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy with efficiencies of up to 60%, compared to about 20-30% for internal combustion engines. This high efficiency translates to better energy utilization and lower energy costs in the long run.
